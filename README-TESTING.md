- Troubleshooting section
- Expected behaviors and outputs
- Configuration explanations

## 🚀 How to Test (Quick Start)

### Step 1: Basic Verification
```bash
npm run test:quickstart
```
**Tests**: Connection → Positions → Signal → Final Status

### Step 2: Individual Features
```bash
npm run test:menu        # See all options
npm run test:conflict    # Test Buy vs Sell conflicts
npm run test:multiple    # Test multiple same-token positions
npm run test:quick       # Test 2-minute auto-exit
```

### Step 3: Full Validation
```bash
npm run test:multi       # Complete test suite (15-20 min)
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

### ✅ Functionality Tested
- [x] **Legacy Support**: Original functionality preserved
- [x] **Multi-Position Management**: Multiple positions per token
- [x] **Conflict Resolution**: Buy vs Put Options handling
- [x] **Risk Management**: Exposure limits and position sizing
- [x] **Position Grouping**: Token-based organization
- [x] **Automated Monitoring**: Real-time price tracking
- [x] **Exit Strategies**: Time-based and target-based exits
- [x] **Error Handling**: Graceful failure scenarios

### 🎯 Test Scenarios
1. **Multiple Same Token** (AAVE): 3 buy signals, merge/separate behavior
2. **Conflicting Signals** (ARB): Buy vs Put Options conflict resolution
3. **Different Tokens** (WETH, UNI, BAL, COMP, OP): Parallel position management
4. **Risk Management** (WBTC): Large position rejection
5. **Position Limits**: 4th position rejection (3 max per token)
6. **Quick Exit** (CRV): 2-minute automated monitoring
7. **Live Monitoring**: Real-time position tracking
